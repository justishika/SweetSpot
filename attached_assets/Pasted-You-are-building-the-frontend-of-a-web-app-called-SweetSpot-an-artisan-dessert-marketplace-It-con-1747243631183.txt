You are building the frontend of a web app called SweetSpot – an artisan dessert marketplace. It connects small-batch bakers and home-based dessert creators to customers.

Use JavaScript (ES6+) for scripting and Tailwind CSS for styling. Set up the project using React. Keep the code modular, clean, and maintainable.

Design Goals:
A soft, Pinterest-style UI with aesthetic visuals that are calming, inviting, and delightful — imagine muted pastels, rounded cards, subtle shadows, and airy layouts.

Use Tailwind CSS to achieve a minimal, elegant, and soft look with responsive design.

Fonts should be modern and clean (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Quicksand from Google Fonts).

UI should resemble a mood board or product catalog.

Core Pages to Build:
Home Page

Hero section with a welcome message and imagery of desserts.

Grid of featured desserts (product cards with image, name, short description, and rating).

Dessert Catalog Page

Filter bar for dietary type, occasion, and flavor.

Pinterest-style masonry or grid layout for dessert cards.

Hover animations for card details.

Product Detail Page

Large image with zoom hover effect.

Description, ingredients, allergy info.

Customization options (dropdowns, checkboxes).

Add to cart button.

Cart and Checkout Pages

Show selected items, quantities, total price.

Minimal, clean forms for delivery info and payment.

Replit Setup Requirements:
Set up React using create-react-app or Vite.

Use React Router for navigation between pages.

Use Tailwind CSS (installed and configured).

Keep components in separate folders/files (e.g., components/, pages/, assets/).

Use placeholder images (e.g., Unsplash or Pexels dessert photos).

Use dummy JSON data for product listings initially.

Bonus (Optional):
Add a sticky header with a logo and nav links.

Add a floating “Back to Top” button.

Responsive behavior on mobile (e.g., collapsible nav).

Be consistent with soft animations, subtle transitions, and a delightful pastel theme. Keep it intuitive and visually polished — like Pinterest meets a dessert boutique.
